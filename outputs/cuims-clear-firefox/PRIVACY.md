# CUIMS Clear Privacy

CUIMS Clear does not collect, transmit, sell, or share user data.

The student UID, CUIMS password, and extension preferences are stored only in Chrome's
local extension storage in the user's current browser profile. They are used only to fill
the CUIMS login page and control the extension's on-page behavior.

CAPTCHA solving runs entirely on the user's device. The OCR engine (Tesseract.js), its
WebAssembly binary, and the English language model are bundled inside the extension
package. The CAPTCHA image is read and processed locally in the browser; it is never
uploaded, and the extension makes no network requests of its own. It includes no
analytics, advertising, or remote code.

The user can delete the stored UID and password at any time with **Clear login** in the
extension popup, or remove all stored settings by uninstalling the extension.

The extension has access only to pages under `https://students.cuchd.in/*`.

Chrome extension storage is not encrypted. Anyone with access to the user's Chrome
profile may be able to read locally stored values.
